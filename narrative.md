### INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------
Welcome to the GDI Intro to Web Concepts class.

How many of you are at your first GDI event? Who we are

This class is near and dear to my heart. Give you background on me. I remember being interested in tech, but was totally overwhelmed by all of the acronyms. I asked what a server is.

We are going to make no assumptions and stop for any and all questions, so that you won't feel clueless and you will leave with some idea of where to get started if you want to go deeper.
