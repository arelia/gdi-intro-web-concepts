### INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------
Welcome to the GDI Intro to Web Concepts class.

How many of you are at your first GDI event? Who we are

This class is near and dear to my heart. Give you background on me. I remember being interested in tech, but was totally overwhelmed by all of the acronyms. I asked what a server is.

We are going to make no assumptions and stop for any and all questions, so that you won't feel clueless and you will leave with some idea of where to get started if you want to go deeper.

We are going to answer these questions today:
- How does a web page work?
- What goes into building a web site/web application?
(distinction of GDI, we focus on the web, so obviously there is a large portion of software development that doesn't involve the web, but that is what we focus on and the underlying principles are the same)
- What do I need to know to get started?
- How does this translate into a profession?
